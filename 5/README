1. An array-and-index expression is equivalent to one written
   as a pointer and offset. 
   There is one difference between an array name(a) and a pointer(pa).
   A pointer is a variable, so pa=a and pa++ are legal. But an
   array name is not a variable; a=pa and a++ are illegal.

2. a[-1] is syntactically legal.

3. If p and q point to elements of the same array, and p<q, 
   then q-p+1 is the number of elements from p to q inclusive.

4. The value of *t++ is the character that t pointed to 
   before t was incremented.

5. Multi-dimensional array as function's argument or declaration, 
   only the first dimension(subscript) of an array can be not specified; 
   all the others have to be specified.

6. The format argument of printf can be an expression.
   E.g., printf ((argc > 1) ? "%s " : "%s", *++argv);
