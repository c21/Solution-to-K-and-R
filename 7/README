1. printf's return value: the number of characters printed.

2. function declaration with variable-length argument list
   int f(int a, double b, ...)
   where the  ... means that the number and types of these arguments
   may vary. The declaration ... can only appear at the end of an argument list.
   There must be at least one named argument.
   va_list p;
   va_start(p, b)
   va_arg(p, /*int,double,...*/)
   ... 
   va_end(p)
